xkcd, sometimes styled XKCD, is a webcomic created by American author Randall Munroe.
The comic's tagline describes it as "A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language".
Munroe states on the comic's website that the name of the comic is not an initialism but "just a word with no phonetic pronunciation".

The subject matter of the comic varies from statements on life and love to mathematical, programming, and scientific in-jokes.
Some strips feature simple humor or pop-culture references.
Although it has a cast of stick figures, the comic occasionally features landscapes, graphs and charts, and intricate mathematical patterns such as fractals.
New cartoons are added three times a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

Munroe has released three spinoff books from the comic.
The first book, chronologically, published in 2010 and entitled xkcd: volume 0 was a series of select comics from his website.
His 2014 book What If? is based on his blog of the same name that answers unusual science questions from readers in a light-hearted but scientifically grounded way.
The What If column on the site is updated with new articles from time to time.
His 2015 book Thing Explainer explains scientific concepts using only the one thousand most commonly used words in English.

As a student, Munroe often drew charts, maps, and "stick figure battles" in the margins of his school notebooks, besides solving mathematical problems unrelated to his classes.
By the time he graduated from university, Munroe's "piles of notebooks" became too large and he started scanning the images.

Munroe has been a fan of newspaper comic strips since childhood, describing xkcd as an "heir" to Charles M. Schulz's Peanuts.
Despite this influence, xkcd's quirky and technical humor would have been difficult to syndicate in newspapers.
In webcomics, Munroe has said that "one can draw something that appeals to 1 percent of the audience 1 percent of United States, that is three million people, that is more readers than small cartoons can have."
Munroe cited the lack of a need for editorial control due to the low bar of access to the Internet as "a salvation."

Almost all xkcd strips have a tooltip (specified using the title attribute in HTML), the text of which usually contains a secondary punchline or annotation related to that day's comic.

References to Wikipedia articles or to Wikipedia as a whole have occurred several times in xkcd.
A facsimile of a made-up Wikipedia entry for "malamanteau" (a stunt word created by Munroe to poke fun at Wikipedia's writing style) provoked a controversy within Wikipedia that was picked up by various media.

Geographical maps, their various different formats and creation methods are a frequently recurring theme in the comic.
On occasion these maps have been mentioned by analysts due to their imaginative or original presentation of figures or statistics.
In the comic \#1939, "2016 Election Map", colored stick figures are used to display how people voted according to their region giving a clearer picture of how people voted in the 2016 election.
Alan Cole, an economist at the University of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s Wharton School, critically analyzed the map, concluding that it is the most elegant and informative he has seen
