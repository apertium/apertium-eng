# English: apertium-eng

This is an Apertium monolingual language package for English. What you can use this language package for:

* Morphological analysis of English
* Morphological generation of English
* Part-of-speech tagging of English

## Requirements

You will need the following software installed:

* lttoolbox (>= 3.5.0)
* apertium (>= 3.6.0)
* vislcg3 (>= 1.3.0)

If this does not make any sense, we recommend you look at: https://apertium.org

## Compiling

Given the requirements being installed, you should be able to just run:

```console
$ ./autogen.sh
$ make
```

If you're doing development, you don't have to install the data, you can use it directly from this directory.

If you are installing this language package as a prerequisite for an Apertium translation pair, then do (typically as root / with sudo):

```console
# make install
```

You can give a `--prefix` to `./autogen.sh` to install as a non-root user, but make sure to use the same prefix when installing the translation pair and any other language packages.

If any of this doesn't make sense or doesn't work, see https://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Install_language_data_by_compiling

## Testing

If you are in the source directory after running make, the following commands should work:

$  echo "the blue house" | apertium -d . eng-morph
^the/the<det><def><sp>$ ^blue/blue<n><sg>/blue<adj><sint>$ ^house/house<n><sg>/house<vblex><inf>/house<vblex><pres>/house<vblex><imp>$

$ echo "the blue house" | apertium -d . eng-tagger
^the<det><def><sp>$ ^blue<adj><sint>$ ^house<n><sg>$

## Tagger model training

To train the tagger model, do one of the following:

Supervised training:
```console
$ make -f tagger.supervised.make
```

Unsupervised training
```console
$ make -f tagger.unsupervised.make
```

For details on the corpora used in training, check the [corpora information](tagger-data/README.md).

For more information, see https://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Tagger_training

A [perceptron tagger](https://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Perceptron_tagger) model is also included as `eng.perceptron.prob`. If you want to use it, it needs to be called with -gx: `apertium-tagger -gx eng.perceptron.prob`
